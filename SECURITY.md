## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our systems seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please report vulnerabilities by emailing **security@horizonprotocol.xyz**.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours. We ask that you:

1. Do not disclose the vulnerability to the public until we have had reasonable time to correct it.
2. Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before publishing it.
3. Do not exploit the vulnerability to view or modify data that does not belong to you.

Thank you for helping keep Horizon Protocol safe!
